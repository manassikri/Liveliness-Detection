This repository contains the code and all the pre trained files which are used for liveliness detection of human facing for building an anti spoofing algorithm. Here we capture the eye-blink movement using EAR(Eye Aspect Ratio) to capture blinking of eyes. Any still image will have a constant EAR value while for a real face EAR will keep on changing and will drop as the person will blink the eye.
